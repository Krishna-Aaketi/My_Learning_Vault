# ðŸ”¹Git vs GitHub

## 1. What is Git?
- **Type:** Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)  
- **Created by:** Linus Torvalds in 2005  
- **Purpose:** Tracks changes in source code during software development  

### Key Features
- Works locally without internet  
- Branching & merging support  
- Stores history of changes  
- Lightweight and fast  

**Usage:** Developers use Git commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, etc.) to manage repositories on their system.  

---

## 2. What is GitHub?
- **Type:** Cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories  
- **Owned by:** Microsoft  
- **Purpose:** Provides a central place to store, collaborate, and share Git repositories  

### Key Features
- Remote repository hosting  
- Collaboration tools (Pull Requests, Issues, Wiki)  
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)  
- Access control & permissions  
- Social coding (followers, stars, forks)

## 3. Main Difference

| Feature           | Git (Tool)                           | GitHub (Platform)                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | Local version control system         | Cloud-based hosting service for Git repos  |
| **Scope**         | Works on local machine               | Requires Git to work                       |
| **Internet**      | Not needed                           | Needed (for remote operations)             |
| **Collaboration** | Limited to local sharing             | Easy collaboration, PRs, discussions       |
| **Ownership**     | Open-source                          | Microsoft                                  |

# Git vs GitHub â€” Deep Dive

---

## 1. Nature & Scope
- **Git**: A tool (DVCS) you install on your machine. Manages your project history as a graph of commits, entirely offline.  
- **GitHub**: A platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration (PRs, reviews), automation (Actions), and governance (permissions, policies).  

**Key takeaway:** You can use Git without GitHub, but you cannot use GitHub effectively without Git.  

---

## 2. Data Model & Whatâ€™s Actually Stored

### Git (under the hood)
- **Objects**:  
  - *blob* = file contents  
  - *tree* = directory listing (names â†’ blobs/trees)  
  - *commit* = snapshot + metadata (author, message, parents)  
  - *tag* = named pointer (often for releases)  
- **Refs**: `refs/heads/main`, `refs/tags/v1.0`, `HEAD` points to current branch.  
- **Storage**: `.git/` holds objects (loose/packed), refs, config.  
- **History**: DAG (directed acyclic graph). Merges have multiple parents.  

### GitHub (beyond raw Git)
- Stores your repo as a **bare Git repo** on servers.  
- Keeps **platform metadata** not found in `.git/`: PRs, Issues, Comments, Reviews, Reactions, Projects, Discussions, Actions runs, permissions, audit logs.  

**Why it matters:** `git clone` brings your Git history, *not* PR conversations or issue threads. Those live on GitHub.

## 3. Operations: Local vs Remote

### Git (local core)
- Create/track: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`  
- Branching/merging: `git branch`, `git checkout -b`, `git merge`, `git rebase`  
- History surgery: `git revert`, `git reset`, `git cherry-pick`, `git reflog`  
- Inspect: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git blame`  

### GitHub (remote-centric)
- **Remotes**: `git remote add origin <url>`, `git fetch`, `git push`, `git pull`  
- **Pull Requests**: propose merging a branch with reviews & checks  
- **Branch protection**: required reviews, checks, no force-push  
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Releases UI, Environments, Secrets  
- **Integrations**: Webhooks, REST/GraphQL APIs, GitHub Apps  

---

## 4. Collaboration Models
- **Pure Git**: share a bare repo over SSH; push to shared branches (trust-based).  
- **GitHub Fork & PR**: contributors fork â†’ push â†’ PR â†’ merge. Safer for open source.  
- **GitHub Flow**: `main` always deployable â†’ short-lived feature branches â†’ PR â†’ merge â†’ deploy.  
- **Git Flow**: develop, release/*, hotfix/* branches â†’ heavier governance.  
- **Trunk-based**: very short branches, frequent merges, strong CI.  

---

## 5. Identity, Signing, and Auth
- **Git identity**: `user.name` + `user.email` (not authentication).  
- **Commit signing**: GPG/SSH signing â†’ `git log --show-signature`.  
- **GitHub auth**: users, orgs, teams, SSO, PATs, fine-grained tokens.  
- **Enforcement**: required signed commits, CODEOWNERS, review rules.  

---

## 6. CI/CD & Automation
- **Git**: none built-in; can script with hooks.  
- **GitHub**: Actions (`.github/workflows/*.yml`), environments with approvals, reusable workflows, caching, artifacts.  

---

## 7. Project Management & Knowledge
- **Git**: no issues, boards, wiki.  
- **GitHub**: Issues, labels, milestones, assignees, Projects (boards), Wiki, Discussions, closing keywords in commits/PRs (`Fixes #123`).  

---

## 8. Security & Compliance
- **Git**: Local history, signing, hooks.  
- **GitHub**: private repos, RBAC, branch protection, secret scanning, Dependabot, code scanning (SARIF), audit logs, IP allowlists.  

---

## 9. Large Files & Monorepos
- **Git & binaries**: poor diffs â†’ repo bloat.  
- **Git LFS**: stores pointers in Git, content separately.  
- **GitHub**: LFS quotas, sparse/partial checkout, monorepo features (code search, path-owned reviews).  

---

## 10. Hooks & Extensibility
- **Git**: client hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg), server hooks (pre-receive).  
- **GitHub**: webhooks, Checks API, Apps, Actions pipelines.  

---

## 11. Hosting Options & Cost
- **Git**: free, open source. Host anywhere (server, NAS).  
- **GitHub**: cloud (GitHub.com) & Enterprise Server (self-hosted). Pricing varies.  

---

## 12. Offline vs Online
- **Git**: fully offline (commit, branch, rebase on a plane).  
- **GitHub**: needs internet for clone, push, PRs, CI, reviews.  

---

## 13. Performance & Scaling
- **Git**: packfiles, delta compression, gc, shallow/partial clones, sparse checkout.  
- **GitHub**: optimized server-side; client still needs shallow/sparse clone for big repos.  

---

## 14. Common Pitfalls (and fixes)
- **Force-push to shared branches** â†’ use branch protection.  
- **Secrets in history** â†’ GitHub secret scanning, pre-commit hooks.  
- **Large binaries** â†’ use Git LFS early.  
- **CRLF vs LF** â†’ configure `.gitattributes` & `core.autocrlf`.  
- **Long-lived branches** â†’ favor small PRs, frequent merges.

## 16. Practical Workflows (Side-by-Side)

### Local-only (pure Git)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main

# share via bare repo on server:
git clone --bare . /srv/git/myrepo.git
# collaborators add remote over SSH
