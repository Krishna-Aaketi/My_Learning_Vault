# Git vs GitHub

## 1. What is Git?
- **Type:** Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)  
- **Created by:** Linus Torvalds in 2005  
- **Purpose:** Tracks changes in source code during software development  

### Key Features
- Works locally without internet  
- Branching & merging support  
- Stores history of changes  
- Lightweight and fast  

**Usage:** Developers use Git commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, etc.) to manage repositories on their system.

## 2. What is GitHub?
- **Type:** Cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories  
- **Owned by:** Microsoft  
- **Purpose:** Provides a central place to store, collaborate, and share Git repositories  

### Key Features
- Remote repository hosting  
- Collaboration tools (Pull Requests, Issues, Wiki)  
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)  
- Access control & permissions  
- Social coding (followers, stars, forks)
