# 🔹Git vs GitHub

## 1. What is Git?
- **Type:** Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)  
- **Created by:** Linus Torvalds in 2005  
- **Purpose:** Tracks changes in source code during software development  

### Key Features
- Works locally without internet  
- Branching & merging support  
- Stores history of changes  
- Lightweight and fast  

**Usage:** Developers use Git commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, etc.) to manage repositories on their system.  

---

## 2. What is GitHub?
- **Type:** Cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories  
- **Owned by:** Microsoft  
- **Purpose:** Provides a central place to store, collaborate, and share Git repositories  

### Key Features
- Remote repository hosting  
- Collaboration tools (Pull Requests, Issues, Wiki)  
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)  
- Access control & permissions  
- Social coding (followers, stars, forks)

## 3. Main Difference

| Feature           | Git (Tool)                           | GitHub (Platform)                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | Local version control system         | Cloud-based hosting service for Git repos  |
| **Scope**         | Works on local machine               | Requires Git to work                       |
| **Internet**      | Not needed                           | Needed (for remote operations)             |
| **Collaboration** | Limited to local sharing             | Easy collaboration, PRs, discussions       |
| **Ownership**     | Open-source                          | Microsoft                                  |

# Git vs GitHub — Deep Dive

---

## 1. Nature & Scope
- **Git**: A tool (DVCS) you install on your machine. Manages your project history as a graph of commits, entirely offline.  
- **GitHub**: A platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration (PRs, reviews), automation (Actions), and governance (permissions, policies).  

**Key takeaway:** You can use Git without GitHub, but you cannot use GitHub effectively without Git.  

---

## 2. Data Model & What’s Actually Stored

### Git (under the hood)
- **Objects**:  
  - *blob* = file contents  
  - *tree* = directory listing (names → blobs/trees)  
  - *commit* = snapshot + metadata (author, message, parents)  
  - *tag* = named pointer (often for releases)  
- **Refs**: `refs/heads/main`, `refs/tags/v1.0`, `HEAD` points to current branch.  
- **Storage**: `.git/` holds objects (loose/packed), refs, config.  
- **History**: DAG (directed acyclic graph). Merges have multiple parents.  

### GitHub (beyond raw Git)
- Stores your repo as a **bare Git repo** on servers.  
- Keeps **platform metadata** not found in `.git/`: PRs, Issues, Comments, Reviews, Reactions, Projects, Discussions, Actions runs, permissions, audit logs.  

**Why it matters:** `git clone` brings your Git history, *not* PR conversations or issue threads. Those live on GitHub.  

---

## 3. Operations: Local vs Remote

### Git (local core)
- Create/track: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`  
- Branching/merging: `git branch`, `git checkout -b`, `git merge`, `git rebase`  
- History surgery: `git revert`, `git reset`, `git cherry-pick`, `git reflog`  
- Inspect: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git blame`  

### GitHub (remote-centric)
- **Remotes**: `git remote add origin <url>`, `git fetch`, `git push`, `git pull`  
- **Pull Requests**: propose merging a branch with reviews & checks  
- **Branch protection**: required reviews, checks, no force-push  
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Releases UI, Environments, Secrets  
- **Integrations**: Webhooks, REST/GraphQL APIs, GitHub Apps  

---

## 4. Collaboration Models
- **Pure Git**: share a bare repo over SSH; push to shared branches (trust-based).  
- **GitHub Fork & PR**: contributors fork → push → PR → merge. Safer for open source.  
- **GitHub Flow**: `main` always deployable → short-lived feature branches → PR → merge → deploy.  
- **Git Flow**: develop, release/*, hotfix/* branches → heavier governance.  
- **Trunk-based**: very short branches, frequent merges, strong CI.  

---

## 5. Identity, Signing, and Auth
- **Git identity**: `user.name` + `user.email` (not authentication).  
- **Commit signing**: GPG/SSH signing → `git log --show-signature`.  
- **GitHub auth**: users, orgs, teams, SSO, PATs, fine-grained tokens.  
- **Enforcement**: required signed commits, CODEOWNERS, review rules.  

---

## 6. CI/CD & Automation
- **Git**: none built-in; can script with hooks.  
- **GitHub**: Actions (`.github/workflows/*.yml`), environments with approvals, reusable workflows, caching, artifacts.  

---

## 7. Project Management & Knowledge
- **Git**: no issues, boards, wiki.  
- **GitHub**: Issues, labels, milestones, assignees, Projects (boards), Wiki, Discussions, closing keywords in commits/PRs (`Fixes #123`).  

---

## 8. Security & Compliance
- **Git**: Local history, signing, hooks.  
- **GitHub**: private repos, RBAC, branch protection, secret scanning, Dependabot, code scanning (SARIF), audit logs, IP allowlists.  

---

## 9. Large Files & Monorepos
- **Git & binaries**: poor diffs → repo bloat.  
- **Git LFS**: stores pointers in Git, content separately.  
- **GitHub**: LFS quotas, sparse/partial checkout, monorepo features (code search, path-owned reviews).  

---

## 10. Hooks & Extensibility
- **Git**: client hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg), server hooks (pre-receive).  
- **GitHub**: webhooks, Checks API, Apps, Actions pipelines.  

---

## 11. Hosting Options & Cost
- **Git**: free, open source. Host anywhere (server, NAS).  
- **GitHub**: cloud (GitHub.com) & Enterprise Server (self-hosted). Pricing varies.  

---

## 12. Offline vs Online
- **Git**: fully offline (commit, branch, rebase on a plane).  
- **GitHub**: needs internet for clone, push, PRs, CI, reviews.  

---

## 13. Performance & Scaling
- **Git**: packfiles, delta compression, gc, shallow/partial clones, sparse checkout.  
- **GitHub**: optimized server-side; client still needs shallow/sparse clone for big repos.  

---

## 14. Common Pitfalls (and fixes)
- **Force-push to shared branches** → use branch protection.  
- **Secrets in history** → GitHub secret scanning, pre-commit hooks.  
- **Large binaries** → use Git LFS early.  
- **CRLF vs LF** → configure `.gitattributes` & `core.autocrlf`.  
- **Long-lived branches** → favor small PRs, frequent merges.

## 16. Practical Workflows (Side-by-Side)

### Local-only (pure Git)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main

# share via bare repo on server:
git clone --bare . /srv/git/myrepo.git
# collaborators add remote over SSH
```
### GitHub Fork & PR
```bash
# create repo on GitHub first
git remote add origin git@github.com:org/app.git
git push -u origin main

git checkout -b feat/login
# ...make changes...
git commit -m "feat: login page"
git push -u origin feat/login
# open PR on GitHub, get reviews/checks → merge
```
## 🔹 17. Mental Model TL;DR

- **Git** = database of file snapshots + commands to manipulate history.  
- **GitHub** = collaboration layer: reviews, policies, automation, and visibility around that database.

- Commit and push updated code  

**Q10. Difference between Fork and Clone in GitHub?**  
- **Clone:** Copy repository to your **local machine**  
- **Fork:** Copy repository under your **GitHub account** to propose changes  

**Q11. Can Git be used without GitHub in a corporate environment?**  
Yes. Companies often host private Git servers (GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted Git).  

### Interview-Focused Deep Questions (with crisp answers)

**Q1. Git vs GitHub in one line?**  
- Git tracks code history; GitHub orchestrates collaboration and automation around Git.  

**Q2. What does `git commit` store that a PR does not?**  
- A commit stores a snapshot + metadata in your local repo.  
- A PR is platform metadata that references commits and hosts discussion/reviews.  

**Q3. How does Git represent a merge?**  
- As a commit with multiple parents; history remains a DAG.  

**Q4. merge vs rebase — and how GitHub policies affect them?**  
- `merge`: preserves branch topology.  
- `rebase`: rewrites history for linearity.  
- GitHub can enforce “linear history” (no merges) or allow both.  

**Q5. fetch vs pull?**  
- `fetch`: download remote refs (working tree unchanged).  
- `pull`: `fetch` + `merge` (or `rebase` if configured).  

**Q6. Fast-forward vs non-fast-forward push?**  
- **FF push**: moves a ref ahead with no divergence.  
- **Non-FF**: rewrites remote history; typically blocked on protected branches.  

**Q7. How do you recover from mistakes?**  
- Use `git reflog` to find previous states, then `git reset` or `git revert`.  

**Q8. What are remote-tracking branches?**  
- Local refs (e.g., `origin/main`) that mirror remote state; updated on fetch/pull.  

**Q9. Why use CODEOWNERS?**  
- Auto-request reviews from domain owners; enforce required approvals before merge.  

**Q10. How does Git LFS change storage?**  
- Commits store **pointers**; large content is fetched from LFS storage.  

**Q11. What is a bare repository and why use it?**  
- Repo without working tree (`*.git`).  
- Used on servers/remotes for central push/pull.  

**Q12. Can you sign commits and why would GitHub care?**  
- Yes (GPG/SSH). GitHub can require verified signatures to ensure authorship integrity.  

**Q13. When do you prefer squash-merge?**  
- To keep `main` linear and place a single curated commit per PR (reduces noise).  

**Q14. How to enforce quality gates?**  
- Branch protection: required CI checks, required reviews, dismiss stale reviews, push restrictions.  

**Q15. How to avoid secrets leaking?**  
- Pre-commit scanners, `git update-index --assume-unchanged` for local `.env`, GitHub secret scanning, rotate if leaked.  

**Q16. What happens on `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/feature`?**  
- Push current local `HEAD` to remote branch named `feature`.  

**Q17. Difference between fork and clone?**  
- **Fork**: new repo on GitHub under your account.  
- **Clone**: local copy of an existing repo.  

**Q18. How do you link Issues and PRs?**  
- Use closing keywords in PR descriptions (`Fixes #123`) or reference issues in commits/PRs.  

**Q19. Monorepo tips?**  
- Sparse checkout, partial clone, per-directory CODEOWNERS, path-based CI.  

**Q20. When to avoid rebase?**  
- On public/shared branches after others have pulled — rewriting history causes pain.
