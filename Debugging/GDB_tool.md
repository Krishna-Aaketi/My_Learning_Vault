# GDB â€“ GNU Debugger (Full Detailed Explanation)

## ðŸ”· 1. What is GDB?
GDB (GNU Debugger) is a powerful open-source debugging tool used to analyze and control the execution of C, C++, and Assembly programs. It allows you to:

- Inspect variables and memory
- Set breakpoints and watchpoints
- Step through source code
- Debug both user space and embedded applications
- Analyze core dumps
- Attach to a running process

## ðŸ”· 2. Why GDB?
Memory corruption, segmentation faults, and logic bugs are hard to catch by just reading code or using printf. GDB helps you:

- Trace runtime errors
- Understand program flow
- Examine variable values at any point
- Modify variables and control program execution during debugging

## ðŸ”· 3. GDB Architecture Overview
GDB operates in two modes:

- **Local Debugging**: Debug your own compiled program
- **Remote Debugging**: Debug a target program running on another system (via `gdbserver`)

### ðŸ”¹ Flow:

```
[Source Code] â†’ [Compile with -g] â†’ [Run in GDB] â†’ [Breakpoints/Inspect/Modify/Step]
```

## ðŸ”· 4. How to Install GDB

### Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install gdb
```

### Fedora/RHEL:

```bash
sudo dnf install gdb
```

### macOS:

```bash
brew install gdb
```

## ðŸ”· 5. Compiling for GDB (With Debug Symbols)
Use `-g` to include debug information:

```bash
gcc -g myprog.c -o myprog
```

Avoid `-O2` or `-O3` during debugging as it optimizes away variables.

## ðŸ”· 6. Starting GDB

```bash
gdb ./myprog
```

Or:

```bash
gdb
(gdb) file myprog
(gdb) run
```

## ðŸ”· 7. Core Commands in GDB

| Command     | Purpose                               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| run         | Start program                          |
| break or b  | Set a breakpoint                       |
| next or n   | Step over (line by line)               |
| step or s   | Step into functions                    |
| continue or c | Resume execution until next breakpoint |
| print or p  | Print variable or expression           |
| list or l   | Show source code                       |
| info locals | Show local variables                   |
| backtrace or bt | Show function call stack          |
| watch       | Watch a variable for changes           |
| quit        | Exit GDB                               |

## ðŸ”· 8. Practical Example

### âž¤ Code: `buggy.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 0;
    int c = a / b;  // divide by zero
    printf("Result: %d\n", c);
    return 0;
}
```

### âž¤ Compile and Debug:

```bash
gcc -g buggy.c -o buggy
gdb ./buggy
```

### âž¤ Inside GDB:

```bash
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) next
(gdb) print a
(gdb) print b
(gdb) backtrace
```

## ðŸ”· 9. Inspecting and Modifying Data

```bash
(gdb) print var
(gdb) set var = 10
```

## ðŸ”· 10. Breakpoints, Watchpoints, Catchpoints

### ðŸ”¹ Breakpoints:

```bash
(gdb) break main
(gdb) break 12
(gdb) delete 1
```

### ðŸ”¹ Conditional Breakpoints:

```bash
(gdb) break 20 if x > 100
```

### ðŸ”¹ Watchpoints:

```bash
(gdb) watch x
```

## ðŸ”· 11. Backtrace (Call Stack)

```bash
(gdb) backtrace
#0  main at main.c:5
```

Use `frame`, `up`, `down` to navigate.

## ðŸ”· 12. Debugging Segmentation Fault

```bash
gdb ./myprog
(gdb) run
# Crashes with SIGSEGV
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) list
```

## ðŸ”· 13. Examining Memory

```bash
(gdb) x/4x &var        # View 4 words in hex
(gdb) x/s ptr          # View string at ptr
(gdb) x/20xb ptr       # View 20 bytes at address
```

## ðŸ”· 14. Debugging Core Dumps

Enable core dumps:

```bash
ulimit -c unlimited
```

Run program (will crash and create core file).

Load into GDB:

```bash
gdb ./myprog core
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) list
```

## ðŸ”· 15. Remote Debugging with gdbserver

### On Target (e.g. ARM board):

```bash
gdbserver :1234 ./myprog
```

### On Host:

```bash
arm-linux-gnueabi-gdb myprog
(gdb) target remote <IP>:1234
(gdb) break main
(gdb) continue
```

## ðŸ”· 16. TUI Mode (Text UI)

```bash
gdb -tui ./myprog
```

Press Ctrl+X + A to switch views.

## ðŸ”· 17. Scripting with GDB

```bash
# script.gdb
break main

quit
```

Run it:
