# Valgrind – Memory Debugging and Profiling Tool

## 1. What is Valgrind?
Valgrind is an open-source instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools.  
Its most popular tool is **Memcheck**, which detects:
- Memory leaks
- Use of uninitialized memory
- Invalid memory accesses
- Double frees

Valgrind runs programs inside a synthetic CPU, checking each memory operation.

---

## 2. Why Use Valgrind?
Memory-related bugs can cause:
- Segmentation faults
- Random crashes
- Silent data corruption
- Security vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free)

Valgrind helps:
- Find the exact location of illegal memory access.
- Detect memory leaks (unfreed allocations).
- Trace heap usage over program lifetime.
- Verify that freed memory is not accessed again.

---

## 3. How Valgrind Works
- It recompiles machine code on the fly (JIT-like) to insert checking instructions.
- Slows program execution (about **20x slower** than native).
- Works without recompiling your code (but debugging symbols `-g` are recommended).

---

## 4. Installation

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install valgrind
```

**On Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install valgrind
```

---

## 5. Basic Usage

Run your program under Valgrind:
```bash
valgrind ./my_program
```

With debugging info and Memcheck:
```bash
gcc -g my_program.c -o my_program
valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_program
```

---

## 6. Commonly Used Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--leak-check=full` | Detailed leak reports. |
| `--show-leak-kinds=all` | Show all leak types (definite, indirect, possible). |
| `--track-origins=yes` | Trace uninitialized values to their origin. |
| `--num-callers=<n>` | Number of stack frames to show in error reports. |
| `--log-file=<file>` | Save output to a file. |

**Example:**
```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes ./my_program
```

---

## 7. Example Output

**Code with a memory leak:**
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    int *p = malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); // allocated but not freed
    p[0] = 42;
    return 0;
}
```

**Valgrind output:**
```
==12345== 40 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==12345==    at 0x4C2FB55: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:299)
==12345==    by 0x10915B: main (example.c:3)
```

**Interpretation:**
- *Definitely lost* = memory leak (never freed).
- Shows file, line number, and call stack.

## 8. Valgrind Tools

Valgrind includes multiple tools (**Memcheck is default**):

| Tool       | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| memcheck   | Detects memory errors & leaks. |
| cachegrind | Cache & branch prediction profiler. |
| callgrind  | Function call profiling. |
| massif     | Heap profiler. |
| helgrind   | Detects threading race conditions. |
| drd        | Another thread error detector. |

Run with a specific tool:
```bash
valgrind --tool=helgrind ./my_program
```

---

## 9. Limitations
- Slower execution (~20x slower).
- Doesn’t catch all stack corruption issues.
- Needs debug symbols (`-g`) for best results.
- Limited on some embedded platforms.
